# GHC Differentials

This repository acts as a staging area for the version control history of
Differentials submitted to GHC's [Phabricator
instance](http://phabricator.haskell.org).

It contains tags with names of the form,
 * `phabricator/base/1234`: The base commit of revision 1234
 * `phabricator/diff/1234`: The head commit of revision 1234

Note that a "revision" is not a differential; rather, it is a specific version
of a differential.
