    Couldn't match expected type ‘Showable -> t’ with actual type ‘()’
    Relevant bindings include
      qux :: t (bound at records-exquant.hs:8:1)
    The function ‘a’ is applied to one argument,
    but its type ‘()’ has none
    In the expression: a (Showable True)
    In an equation for ‘qux’: qux = a (Showable True)
